			<p>Hey there! I'm <a href="http://www.schlosslab.org" target="_blank">Pat Schloss</a>, I'm a professor in the <a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/" target="_blank">Department of Microbiology & Immunology</a> in the <a href="https://www.umich.edu" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> <a href="https://medicine.umich.edu" target="_blank">School of Medicine</a>. Recently, a multibillion dollar pharmaceutical company hired their third postdoc from my research group. It dawned on me that nearly all of the former members of my group had joined our team with virtually none of the data analysis skills that their commercial, academic, non-profit, and goverment employers were hiring them for. What happened? These scientists received a well-rounded training in reproducible data analysis from being in my group.</p>

			<p>Sadly, I don't have room for everyone to join my lab and get this training. But I do have the ability to help spread the concepts and training I share with my trainees! If you want this training, <i>Riffomonas</i> Professional Development can help. If you don't see what you need, let me know and perhaps we can set something up to serve you and others better.</p>

			<p>This initiative was initially developed through grant support from the National Institutes of Health (R25 GM116149).</p>
