<p>This
workshop is geared towards people who would like to learn R or to learn
it better using a diverse collection of datasets. This workshop is
intended for beginners and more advanced R programmers who would like
to fill their gaps in knowledge. I assume no previous computer
programming experience. I teach the workshop using a livecoding approach that
emphasizes hands on learning of R with real data. The material is
centered on learning how to solve problems using functions from the
"tidyverse". The workshop will give you a pretty thorough set of working
examples for how to use packages like ggplot2, readr, dplyr, stringr, and
lubridate. More importantly, the workshop will emphasize developing
problem solving skills for solving data and programming problems. The
materials can be found on the <a href="http://www.riffomonas.org/generalR/">Riffomonas website</a></p>
