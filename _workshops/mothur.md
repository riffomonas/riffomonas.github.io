<p>This workshop is geared towards people with diverse backgrounds so you
shouldn't feel like this isn't for you if you are a beginner. I assume
no previous computer programming experience. The workshop is an even
blend of lecture/discussion and hands on use of mothur with real
sequence data. The workshop is an expanded discussion on the <a href="https://www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP">MiSeq SOP</a>. Here is a rough outline of what the workshop schedule
will look like (although it is subject to some minor changes)...<p>
