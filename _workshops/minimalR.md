<p>The minimalR
workshop is geared towards people with interests in microbial ecology
that would like to learn R or to learn it better. So, you shouldn't feel
like this isn't for you if you are a beginner. I assume no previous
computer programming experience. The workshop is taught via livecoding and
emphasizes hands on use of R with real data. It uses mothur output files as a starting point, although the principles are broadly applicable. It is taught around the
generation of data visualization methods commonly used by microbial
ecologists. Along the way we'll learn a number of ways to work with
data from within R. Here is a rough outline of what the workshop
schedule will look like (it is subject to some minor changes)...</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ordination</li>
  <li>Stripcharts and box and whisker plots</li>
  <li>Line plots</li>
  <li>Barcharts</li>
  <li>Subsetting data</li>
  <li>Reading and writing data</li>
  <li>Basic parametric and non-parametric analyses</li>
</ul>

<p>The workshop will give you a pretty thorough set of working examples for
how to use packages like readr, dplyr, and ggplot2 with data from
mothur; however, prior knowledge of mothur is not a prerequisite. The
materials we will follow are available on the <a href="/minimalR">Riffomonas website</a></p>
